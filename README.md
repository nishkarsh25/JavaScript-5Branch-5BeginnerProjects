# MyCalculatorApp

This is a simple calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides users with a convenient way to perform basic arithmetic calculations right in their web browser.


## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The calculator is designed to adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division by clicking on the respective buttons. The calculator supports multi-step calculations and follows standard arithmetic precedence rules.

- **Clear and Backspace Functionality:** Users can clear the input field by clicking the "C" button, and they can delete the last entered character using the "&lt;" button.

- **Dynamic Calculation:** The calculator evaluates mathematical expressions in real-time as users input numbers and operators. It utilizes JavaScript's `eval()` function to perform the calculations.
